# Three Point Polar Alignment

Three Point Polar Alignment (3PPA) automates polar alignment inside N.I.N.A. by plate-solving three pointings and guiding adjustments without a separate application.

## Key Capabilities
- Captures three sky positions, plate-solves them, and computes polar error vectors with on-screen correction guidance.
- Provides real-time error updates as adjustments are made, supporting both Alt/Az screws and tripod tweaks.
- Integrates with the advanced sequencer so alignment can run at session start before focusing or target acquisition.

## Workflow Notes
- Select the “Alignment Mode: Three Point PA” option in the plugin dock and ensure plate-solving is configured.
- Use short exposures (1–2 s) with binning to speed up iterations, especially when near the pole.
- Document the final polar error in session metadata for historical tracking.
