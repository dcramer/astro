# N.I.N.A. Assets

## Purpose
Collect every file and guide needed to reproduce our N.I.N.A. automation environment in one place.

## Contents
- **templates/** - Advanced Sequencer exports synchronized with the live profile.
- **plugins/** - Configuration notes for each plugin we rely on.
- **ops/** - Runbooks, SOPs, and troubleshooting steps tied to N.I.N.A. workflows.

## Maintenance
- Keep exports and plugin notes in sync with the running system after simulator or field validation.
- Record process changes (import/export, troubleshooting) under `ops/` so the next operator can follow along.
